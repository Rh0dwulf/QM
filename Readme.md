Description
------------

This is a series of python scripts for educational purposes made in jupyter notebooks platform.

In essence, this scripts try to simulate the classical behavior of "two incomunicated students" that strive to reproduce, unsuccessfully, the behavior of two entangled photons.
 
Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon without classical analog. In the literature, it is usually considered to be the quantum characteristic. In this work, we show that quantum entanglement-like correlations cannot be reproduced for any classical protocol. We build a computational simulation  of the well known scheme of non-communicating students. In this scheme, the students cannot manipulate the quantum systems but they may have set up in advance a common strategy and have shared some common classical data in order to reproduce given quantum correlations of such systems. By thoroughly searching in the whole space of classical strategies we conclude that Local Operations and Classical Communications (LOCC) does not satisfy the geometrical constraints imposed by quantum entanglement.
